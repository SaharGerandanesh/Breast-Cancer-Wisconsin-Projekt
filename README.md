# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Projekt
This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. We utilized three supervised machine learning models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we explored relationships between key features like radius, texture, and concavity, which play crucial roles in differentiating between malignant and benign tumors. The models were fine-tuned using GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters, improving their performance.

XGBoost was selected as the final model due to its superior accuracy of 97%. We also combined Random Forest and XGBoost with dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and UMAP to improve model interpretability.

The implementation of this model in clinical settings can improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce costs, and automate part of the decision-making process, benefiting both healthcare professionals and patients.
